Portland offers a variety of places to stay while in town. We are recommending that guests stay in the downtown area for easy access to the wedding venue and fun things to do in Portland.

Below, you will find some of the hotels offering good rates that are within walking distance of the wedding venue.

<strong>Hotel Deluxe</strong> (<a href="http://www.hoteldeluxeportland.com/">link</a>)<br />

A beautiful hotel located near where we live and within blocks of the wedding venue. It is out of the main downtown area, but only a few minute walk away from downtown. They have an excellent restaurant that is perfect for any meals that you need.

<strong>Portland Marriott City Center</strong> (<a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/pdxct-portland-marriott-city-center/">link</a>)<br />

A great hotel in the middle of downtown Portland, which is just 2 blocks north of Pioneer Square, Portland's downtown centerpiece. It's a little farther away from the wedding venue (about 12 blocks), but still a great location. 

<strong>The Governor Hotel</strong> (<a href="http://www.governorhotel.com/">link</a>)<br />
614 SW 11th Ave ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=The+Governor+Hotel+Portland%2C+Southwest+11th+Avenue%2C+Portland%2C+OR&data=!2m1!6s0x54950a049f8aab7b%3A0x571df4601ea24f34!4m15!2m14!1m13!1s0x54950a035f41d4cf%3A0x776c285f8c70615a!3m8!1m3!1d5060!2d-122.6802656!3d45.520382!3m2!1i1305!2i695!4f13.1!4m2!3d45.520639!4d-122.682682))<br />

This is a really nice hotel that is a little closer to the venue, but further from our apartment. While it is a fairly upscale hotel, rates have seemed really reasonable lately. It is an excellent location for doing things downtown and getting to and from the wedding venue.
