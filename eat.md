Pok Pok is a fantastic Thai restaurant that is very different than your usual Thai place. It claims to serve food that is found at "pubs, restaurants, and home" in Southeast Asia. The chef is a frequent award winning chef and he cooks some amazing meals. Laura really enjoys the brussel sprouts and Zack is a fan of the boar's collar. The food is definitely on the spicy side.
